# Dialogs library

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](../includes/applies-to.md)]

*Dialogs* are a central concept in the SDK, providing way to manage a long-running conversation with the user.
Dialogs include state management and control flow features, allowing the bot to pick up where it left off last and to handle a variety of conversation models.

This article describes the core classes and features of the dialog library.
You should be familiar with [how bots work](bot-builder-basics.md) and [managing state](bot-builder-concept-state.md).

Each dialog represents a segment of conversation that can run to completion and return collected information. Each one represents a basic unit of control flow: a dialog can begin, continue, and end; pause and resume; or be canceled.
The dialogs library provides a few built-in dialog types to make your bot's conversation easier to manage.

## Dialog infrastructure

Along with the various types of dialogs, the following classes are involved in the design and control conversations.

A *dialog manager* automates many of the dialog management tasks for you. To run an adaptive dialog (or another dialog that contains an adaptive dialog), you must start the dialog from a dialog manager.

In addition to the dialog manager, the following classes enable the dialog system to maintain dialog state and manage conversation flow.

| Class | Description
| :--   | :--
| *Dialog set* | Defines a collection of dialogs that can reference each other.
| *Dialog context* | Contains information about all active dialogs.
| *Dialog instance* | Contains information about one active dialog.
| *Dialog turn result* | Contains status information from an active dialog. If the active  dialog ended, this contains its return value.

<!-- **cut this**

*Dialog set*: a collection of dialogs.
Each dialog added to the set has a unique ID within the set. When your bot wants to start a certain dialog or prompt within the dialog set, it uses that ID to specify which dialog to use. Both adaptive and component dialogs contain an inner dialog set.

*Dialog instance*: the state of a dialog.
While a dialog class represents a bit of conversation flow, and an instance of that class is what gets added to a dialog set. At run time, the state of the dialog--where in the conversation it is, what information it has collected, and so on--is represented by the *dialog instance* class.
**argh!**

A *dialog context* contains information pertaining to a dialog set, and is used within the framework to interact with those dialogs. The dialog context includes the current turn context, the parent dialog, and the [dialog state](#dialog-state), which provides a method for preserving information within the dialog. The dialog context allows you to start a dialog with its string ID or continue the current dialog (such as a waterfall dialog that has multiple steps).

When a dialog ends, it can return a *dialog result* with some resulting information from the dialog. This is returned to let the calling method see what happened within the dialog and save the information to some persisted location, if desired.
-->

## Dialog types

These are the basic dialog types defined in the dialogs library.

| Type | Description
| :--  | :--
| _dialog_ | The base class for all dialogs.
| _container dialog_ | The base class for all _container_ dialogs. It maintains an inner dialog set and allows you to treat a collection of dialogs as a unit.
| _component dialog_ | A type of container dialog. When a component dialog starts, it starts a designated dialog in its collection. When the inner process completes, the component dialog ends.
| _waterfall dialog_ | Defines a sequence of steps, allowing your bot to guide a user through a linear process. These are designed to work within the context of a component dialog.
| _prompt dialogs_ | Ask the user for input and return the result. A prompt will repeat until it gets valid input or it is canceled. These are designed to work with waterfall dialogs.
| _adaptive dialog_ | A type of container dialog that allows for flexible conversation flow. It includes built-in support for language recognition, language generation, and memory scoping features.
| _action dialogs_ | Represent programmatic structures within an adaptive dialog. These let you design conversation flow much like expressions and statements in a traditional programming language let you design procedural flow in an application.
| _input dialogs_ | Ask the user for input, much like prompt dialogs, but can interact with other structures in an adaptive dialog.
| _skill dialog_ | Automates the management of one or more skill bots from a skill consumer.
| _QnA Maker dialog_ | Automates access to a QnA Maker knowledge base.

## Dialog state

Dialogs are an approach to implementing a multi-turn conversation, and as such, they rely on persisted state across multiple turns. Without state in dialogs, your bot wouldn't know where it was in the conversation or what information it had already gathered. The dialog manager automates many of these tasks for you.

A dialog based bot can hold a dialog set collection as a member variable in its bot implementation. That dialog set is created with a handle to an object called an accessor that provides access to persisted state. For background on state within bots, see [managing state](bot-builder-concept-state.md). The dialog manager manages state for adaptive dialogs.

Within the botâ€™s on turn handler, the bot initializes the dialog subsystem by calling *create context* on the dialog set, which returns a *dialog context*. That dialog context contains the necessary information needed by the dialog.

The creation of a dialog context requires state, which is accessed with the accessor provided when creating the dialog set. With that accessor, the dialog set can get the appropriate dialog state. Details on state accessors can be found in [Save conversation and user data](bot-builder-howto-v4-state.md).

## Container dialogs

The SDK currently implements two types of container dialogs: component dialogs and adaptive dialogs. A container acts as individual dialog and can be part of a larger dialog set. However, each container has an inner dialog set that is managed separately.

While the conceptual structure of the two are quite different, they can be used together.

<!-- **random notes**

The dialog manager creates a dialog set of one for the dialog it is tasked with running. That dialog can be a stand-alone dialog (a QnA Maker, skill, or some custom dialog) or a container dialog.

**ID resolution**

When one dialog tries to start another dialog, it does so by ID. The dialog context tries to resolve the ID based on the other dialogs in the immediate dialog set. If there is no match, it looks for a match in the containing dialog set, and so on. If no match is found, an exception is thrown.
-->

### Component dialogs

Component dialogs use a sequence model for conversations.

### Adaptive dialogs

Adaptive dialogs use a flexible model for conversations.
They offer several built-in capabilities, including interruption handling, attaching a recognizer to each dialog, using the language generation system, and more. With adaptive dialogs, you can focus more on modeling the conversation and less on dialog mechanics.

An adaptive dialog is part of the dialogs library and works with all of the other dialog types.
You can easily build a bot that uses many dialog types.

Consider using adaptive dialogs if your bot:

- Requires the conversation flow to branch or loop based on business logic, user input, or other factors.
- Needs to adjust to context, accept information in an arbitrary order, or allow one conversational thread to pause for a side-conversation and then pick back up again.
- Needs context-specific language understanding models or needs to extract entity information from user input.
- Would benefit from custom input processing or response generation.

The [introduction to adaptive dialogs](bot-builder-adaptive-dialog-introduction.md) and its associated topics describe the features supported by adaptive dialogs: language recognition and language generation support, use of triggers and actions to model conversation flow, and access to memory scopes.

## Dialog types

Dialogs come in a few different types as shown in this class hierarchy.

![dialog classes](media/bot-builder-dialog-classes.png)

Prompt dialogs are designed to work with waterfall dialogs.
Action and input dialogs are designed to work with adaptive dialogs.
Component and adaptive dialogs manage a set of _child_ dialogs.
The skill and QnA Maker dialogs wrap skill and QnA Maker features as dialogs.

### Prompts

Prompts, within the dialogs library, provide an easy way to ask the user for information and evaluate their response. For example for a *number prompt*, you specify the question or information you are asking for, and the prompt automatically checks to see if it received a valid number response. If it did, the conversation can continue; if it didn't, it will re-prompt the user for a valid answer.

Behind the scenes, prompts are a two-step dialog. First, the prompt asks for input; second, it returns the valid value, or starts from the top with a reprompt.

Prompts have *prompt options* given when the prompt is called, which is where you can specify the text to prompt with, the retry prompt if validation fails, and choices to answer the prompt. In general, the prompt and retry prompt properties are activities, though there is some variation on how this is handled in different programming languages.

Additionally, you can choose to add some custom validation for your prompt when you create it. For example, say we wanted to get a party size using the number prompt, but that party size has to be more than 2 and less than 12. The prompt first checks to see if it received a valid number, then runs the custom validation if it is provided. If the custom validation fails, it will re-prompt the user as above.

When a prompt completes, it explicitly returns the resulting value that was asked for. When that value is returned, we can be sure it has passed both the built in prompt validation and any additional custom validation that may have been provided.

For examples on using various prompts, take a look at how to use the [dialogs library to gather user input](bot-builder-prompts.md).

#### Prompt types

Behind the scenes, prompts are a two-step dialog. First, the prompt asks for input; second, it returns the valid value, or restarts from the top with a re-prompt. The dialogs library offers a number of basic prompts, each used for collecting a different type of response. The basic prompts can interpret natural language input, such as "ten" or "a dozen" for a number, or "tomorrow" or "Friday at 10am" for a date-time.

| Prompt | Description | Returns |
|:----|:----|:----|
| _Attachment prompt_ | Asks for one or more attachments, such as a document or image. | A collection of _attachment_ objects. |
| _Choice prompt_ | Asks for a choice from a set of options. | A _found choice_ object. |
| _Confirm prompt_ | Asks for a confirmation. | A Boolean value. |
| _Date-time prompt_ | Asks for a date-time. | A collection of _date-time resolution_ objects. |
| _Number prompt_ | Asks for a number. | A numeric value. |
| _Text prompt_ | Asks for general text input. | A string. |

To prompt a user for input, define a prompt using one of the built-in classes, such as the _text prompt_, and add it to your dialog set. Prompts have fixed IDs that must be unique within a dialog set. You can have a custom validator for each prompt, and for some prompts, you can specify a _default locale_.

#### Prompt locale

The locale is used to determine language-specific behavior of the **choice**, **confirm**, **date-time**, and **number** prompts. For any given input from the user, if the channel provided a _locale_ property in user's message, then that is used. Otherwise, if the prompt's _default locale_ is set, by providing it when calling the prompt's constructor or by setting it later, then that is used. If neither of those are provided, English ("en-us") is used as the locale. Note: The locale is a 2, 3, or 4 character ISO 639 code that represents a language or language family.

### Waterfall dialogs

A waterfall dialog is a specific implementation of a dialog that is commonly used to collect information from the user or guide the user through a series of tasks. Each step of the conversation is implemented as an asynchronous function that takes a *waterfall step context* (`step`) parameter. At each step, the bot [prompts the user for input](bot-builder-prompts.md) (or can begin a child dialog, but that it is often a prompt), waits for a response, and then passes the result to the next step. The result of the first function is passed as an argument into the next function, and so on.

The following diagram shows a sequence of waterfall steps and the stack operations that take place. Details on the use of the dialog stack are below in the [using dialogs](#using-dialogs) section.

![Dialog concept](media/bot-builder-dialog-concept.png)

Within waterfall steps, the context of the waterfall dialog is stored in its *waterfall step context*. This is similar to the dialog context as it provides access to the current turn context and state. Use the waterfall step context object to interact with a dialog set from within a waterfall step.

You can handle a return value from a dialog either within a waterfall step in a dialog or from your bot's on turn handler, although you generally only need to check the status of the dialog turn result from your bot's turn logic.
Within a waterfall step, the dialog provides the return value in the waterfall step context's _result_ property.

#### Waterfall step context properties

The waterfall step context contains the following:

- *Options*: contains input information for the dialog.
- *Values*: contains information you can add to the context, and is carried forward into subsequent steps.
- *Result*: contains the result from the previous step.

Additionally, the *next* method (**NextAsync** in C#, **next** in JS) continues to the next step of the waterfall dialog within the same turn, enabling your bot to skip a certain step if needed.

#### Prompt options

The second parameter of the step context's _prompt_ method takes a _prompt options_ object, which has the following properties.

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| _Prompt_ | The initial activity to send the user, to ask for their input. |
| _Retry prompt_ | The activity to send the user if their first input did not validate. |
| _Choices_ | A list of choices for the user to choose from, for use with a choice prompt. |
| _Validations_ | Additional parameters to use with a custom validator. |
| _Style_ | Defines how the choices for a choice prompt or confirm prompt will be presented to a user. |

You should always specify the initial prompt activity to send the user, as well as a retry prompt for instances when the user's input doesn't validate.

If the user's input isn't valid, the retry prompt is sent to the user; if there was no retry specified, then the initial prompt is re-sent. However, if an activity is sent back to the user from within the validator, no retry prompt is sent.

##### Prompt validation

You can validate a prompt response before returning the value to the next step of the waterfall. A validator function has a _prompt validator context_ parameter and returns a Boolean, indicating whether the input passes validation.
The prompt validator context includes the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| _Context_ | The current turn context for the bot. |
| _Recognized_ | A _prompt recognizer result_ that contains information about the user input, as processed by the recognizer. |
| _Options_ | Contains the _prompt options_ that were provided in the call to start the prompt. |

The prompt recognizer result has the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| _Succeeded_ | Indicates whether the recognizer was able to parse the input. |
| _Value_ | The return value from the recognizer. If necessary, the validation code can modify this value. |

### Component dialog

Sometimes you want to write a reusable dialog that you want to use in different scenarios, such as an address dialog that asks the user to provide values for street, city and zip code.

The *component dialog* provides a strategy for creating independent dialogs to handle specific scenarios, breaking a large dialog set into more manageable pieces. Each of these pieces has its own dialog set, and avoids any name collisions with the dialog set that contains it. See the [component dialog how to](bot-builder-compositcontrol.md) for more on these.

## Using dialogs

<!--

_Replace all this with something simpler, based on use of the dialog manager, and point to component- or adaptive-specific guidance for anything beyond that._

You can use the dialog context to begin, continue, replace, or end a dialog. You can also cancel all dialogs on the dialog stack.

Dialogs can be thought of as a programmatic stack, which we call the *dialog stack*, with the turn handler as the one directing it and serving as the fallback if the stack is empty. The topmost item on that stack is considered the *active dialog*, and the dialog context directs all input to the active dialog.

When a dialog begins, it is pushed onto the stack, and is now the active dialog. It remains the active dialog until it either ends, it is removed by the [replace dialog](#repeating-a-dialog) method, or another dialog is pushed onto the stack (by either the turn handler or active dialog itself) and becomes the active dialog. When that new dialog ends, it is popped off the stack and the next dialog down becomes the active dialog again. This allows for [repeating a dialog](#repeating-a-dialog) or [branching a conversation](#branch-a-conversation), discussed below.

### Create the dialog context

To create your dialog context, call the *create context* method of your dialog set. Create context gets the dialog set's *dialog state* property and uses that to create the dialog context. The dialog context is then used to start, continue, or otherwise control the dialogs in the set.

The dialog set requires use of a *state property accessor* to access the dialog state. The accessor is created and used the same way as other state accessors, but is created as it's own property based off of the conversation state. Details on managing state can be found in the [managing state topic](bot-builder-concept-state.md), and usage of dialog state is shown in the [sequential conversation flow](bot-builder-dialog-manage-conversation-flow.md) how-to.

### To start a dialog

To start a dialog, pass the *dialog ID* you want to start into the dialog context's *begin dialog*, *prompt*, or *replace dialog* method.

- The begin dialog method will push the dialog onto the top of the stack.
- The replace dialog method will pop the current dialog off the stack and push the replacing dialog onto the stack. The replaced dialog is canceled and any information that instance contained is disposed of.

Use the _options_ parameter to pass information to the new instance of the dialog.
The options passed into the new dialog can be accessed via the step context's *options* property in any step of the dialog.
See the [Create advanced conversation flow using branches and loops](bot-builder-dialog-manage-complex-conversation-flow.md) how-to for example code.

### To continue a dialog

To continue a dialog, call the *continue dialog* method. The continue method will always continue the topmost dialog on the stack (the active dialog), if there is one. If the continued dialog ends, control is passed to the parent context which continues within the same turn.

Use the step context's *values* property to persist state between turns.
Any value added to this collection in a previous turn is available in subsequent turns.
See the [Create advanced conversation flow using branches and loops](bot-builder-dialog-manage-complex-conversation-flow.md) how-to for example code.

### To end a dialog

The *end dialog* method ends a dialog by popping it off the stack and returns an optional result to the parent context (such as the dialog that called it, or the bot's turn handler). This is most often called from within the dialog to end the current instance of itself.

You can call the end dialog method from anywhere you have a dialog context, but it will appear to the bot that it was called from the current active dialog.

> [!TIP]
> It is best practice to explicitly call the *end dialog* method at the end of the dialog.

### To clear all dialogs

If you want to pop all dialogs off the stack, you can clear the dialog stack by calling the dialog context's *cancel all dialogs* method.

### Repeating a dialog

You can replace a dialog with itself, creating a loop, by using the *replace dialog* method.
This is a great way to handle [complex interactions](~/v4sdk/bot-builder-dialog-manage-complex-conversation-flow.md) and a good technique to manage menus.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to persist the internal state for the current dialog, you will need to pass information to the new instance of the dialog in the call to the *replace dialog* method, and then initialize the dialog appropriately.

### Branch a conversation

The dialog context maintains the dialog stack and for each dialog on the stack, tracks which step is next. Its *begin dialog* method creates a child and pushes that dialog onto the top of the stack, and its *end dialog* method pops the top dialog off the stack. *End dialog* is usually called from within the dialog that's ending.

A dialog can start a new dialog within the same dialog set by calling the dialog context's *begin dialog* method and providing the ID of the new dialog, which then makes the new dialog the currently active dialog. The original dialog is still on the stack, but calls to the dialog context's *continue dialog* method are only sent to the dialog that is on top of the stack, the *active dialog*. When a dialog is popped off the stack, the dialog context will resume with the next step of the waterfall on the stack where it left off of the original dialog.

Therefore, you can create a branch within your conversation flow by including a step in one dialog that can conditionally choose a dialog to start out of a set of available dialogs.
