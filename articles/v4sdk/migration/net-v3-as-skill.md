# Convert a .NET v3 bot to a skill

Converting an existing v3 bot to a skill takes just a few steps. It allows other bots to access the v3 bot, while allowing users to still access the v3 bot, and can be less risky than migrating the v3 bot to the v3 SDK. Any v4 bot designed to do so can consume a skill.

The skill consumer and skill use the Bot Connector service to communicate with each other. The consumer and skill can be implemented in different languages, such as .NET and JavaScript. For more information, see [about skills](../skills-conceptual.md).

This article describes how to convert 3 sample .NET v3 bots to skills and to create a v4 skill consumer that can access these skills.

To migrate a .NET bot from v3 to v4, see how to [Migrate a .NET v3 bot to a .NET Framework v4 bot](conversion-framework.md).
To convert a JavaScript v3 bot to a skill, see how to [Convert a JavaScript v3 bot to a skill](javascript-v3-as-skill.md).
