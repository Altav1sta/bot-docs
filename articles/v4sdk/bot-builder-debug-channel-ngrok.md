# Debug a channel using ngrok

One of the key features available in Bot Framework is the ability to seamlessly connect your bot to multiple channels all from the same bot. You can read the [connect a bot to channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-manage-channels?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) article to learn more about currently supported channels and how to connect your bots to them.

While your bot is in development, you can debug and test your bot locally using the debugger for [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugger/?view=vs-2019) and Visual Studio Code for the .NET and Node.js SDKâ€™s respectively.
