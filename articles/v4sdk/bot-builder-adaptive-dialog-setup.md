# Create a bot project for adaptive dialogs Â 

[!INCLUDE[applies-to](../includes/applies-to.md)]

If you want to write an adaptive dialog from scratch or consume a dialog that was authored in the Bot Framework Composer, you will need certain scaffolding in place that is not required for other types of bot projects.

This article shows how to create a C# bot project to which you can add adaptive dialogs, including declarative dialogs generated by Composer.

## Prerequisites

## Create a bot project

1. Update your copy of the Bot Framework templates (VSIX or .NET Core) to the latest version.
1. Create a new project based on the **empty bot** template.

For more about these steps, see the [C# quickstart](../dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-sdk-quickstart.md#templates).

## Add NuGet packages

1. Open your project in your preferred IDE.
1. Add the **Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Dialogs.Adaptive** NuGet package as a dependency.
1. Register any additional packages your bot will need:
    - For adaptive dialog unit testing, add the **Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Dialogs.Adaptive.Testing** package.
    - For LUIS language understanding, add the **Microsoft.Bot.Builder.AI.LUIS** package.
    - For QnA Maker language understanding, add the **Microsoft.Bot.Builder.AI.QnA** package.
    - If your bot consumes custom components, it may require additional packages.
      The author of each custom component should clearly state which packages are required.

For more about language understanding in adaptive dialogs, see [recognizers in adaptive dialogs](bot-builder-concept-adaptive-dialog-recognizers.md).

## Register components

To support customization, the adaptive dialogs library uses component registration to discover all components, declarative types, memory scopes, path resolvers, and type converters.

**startup.cs**

Register adaptive and declarative components as necessary for your project.

| Component registration | Required | Description
| :--- | :--- | :---
| `ComponentRegistration.Add(new AdaptiveComponentRegistration());` | Required | Registers components common to all adaptive dialogs.
| `ComponentRegistration.Add(new DialogsComponentRegistration());` | Required | Defines common memory scopes and path resolvers.
| `ComponentRegistration.Add(new AdaptiveTestingComponentRegistration());` | Optional | Registers components used to unit test adaptive dialogs.
| `ComponentRegistration.Add(new DeclarativeComponentRegistration());` | Optional | Registers components used to consume declarative dialogs.
| `ComponentRegistration.Add(new LanguageGenerationComponentRegistration());` | Optional | Registers components used for language generation features.
| `ComponentRegistration.Add(new LuisComponentRegistration());` | Optional | Registers components used for LUIS (language understanding) features.
| `ComponentRegistration.Add(new QnAMakerComponentRegistration());` | Optional | Registers components used for QnA Maker (language understanding) features.
| `ComponentRegistration.Add(new TeamsComponentRegistration());` | Optional | Registers components specific to the Teams channel.

If your project does not register a component that is required by another part of your bot, you can add it later, but you may get an initialization-time or run-time error.

## Add state

- define conversation and user state (register in startup)
- add these to the turn context in your adapter

## Add an adaptive dialog

- create a vestigial root dialog for now (register in startup)

## Add a dialog manager

- modify bot code to expect a root dialog
- modify bot registration in startup
- create and use a dialog manager to run the root dialog
