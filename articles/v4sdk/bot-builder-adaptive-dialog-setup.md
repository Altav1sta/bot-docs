# Create a bot project for adaptive dialogs Â 

[!INCLUDE[applies-to](../includes/applies-to.md)]

If you want to write an adaptive dialog from scratch or consume a dialog that was authored in the Bot Framework Composer, you will need certain scaffolding in place that is not required for other types of bot projects.

This article shows how to create a C# bot project to which you can add adaptive dialogs, including declarative dialogs generated by Composer.

## Prerequisites

## Create an empty bot

1. Update your copy of the Bot Framework templates (VSIX or .NET Core) to the latest version.
1. Create a new project based on the **empty bot** template.

For more information about the first two steps, see the [C# quickstart](../dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-sdk-quickstart.md#templates).

## Add NuGet packages

1. Open your project in your preferred IDE.
1. Add the **Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Dialogs.Adaptive** NuGet package as a dependency.
1. If your bot will include LUIS language understanding features, also add the **Microsoft.Bot.Builder.AI.LUIS** package.
1. If your bot will include QnA Maker language understanding features, also add the **Microsoft.Bot.Builder.AI.QnA** package.
