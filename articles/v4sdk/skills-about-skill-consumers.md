# About skill consumers

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](../includes/applies-to.md)]

A skill can be consumed by various other bots, facilitating reuse, and in this way, you can create a user-facing bot and extend it by consuming your own or 3rd party skills.

From the user's perspective, the root bot is the bot they are interacting with.
From the skill's perspective, the skill consumer is the channel over which it communicates with the user.

<!--
## Skill consumer design
Supports: Bot Framework adapter, custom adapters, MS Teams channel (what Teams calls "proactive" 1-1 conversations, created off a group/channel/team conversation)
-->

As a skill consumer, a root bot includes some additional logic to manage traffic between it and a skill:

- Configuration information for each skill the root uses.
- A _conversation ID factory_ that allows the root to switch back and forth between the conversation it is having with the user and the one it is having with a skill.
- A _skill client_ that can package and forward activities to a skill bot.
- A _skill handler_ that can receive requests and unpack activities from a skill bot.

## Managing skills

Starting and letting a single skill run to completion is managed with a few additions to the skill consumer. More complicated scenarios are possible, with multiple skills or conversation threads.

### Skill descriptions

For each skill, add a _Bot Framework skill_ object to the skill consumer's configuration file. Each one will have an ID, an app ID, and an endpoint for the skill.

| Property | Description
| :--- | :--- |
| _ID_ | The ID or key of the skill, specific to the skill consumer. |
| _App ID_ | The `appId` assigned to the bot resource when the skill was registered on Azure. |
| _Skill endpoint_ | The messaging endpoint for the skill. This is the URL the consumer will use to communicate with the skill. |

### Skill client and skill handler

<!-- Is this still accurate? -->
The skill consumer uses a skill client to send activities to a skill. The client:

- Takes an activity to forward to the skill, either from a user or generated by the consumer.
- Replaces the original conversation reference with one for the consumer-skill conversation.
- Adds a bot-to-bot authentication token.
- Sends the updated activity to the skill.

The skill consumer uses a skill handler to receive activities from a skill. The handler:

- Handles the channel service `SendToConversation` and `ReplyToActivity` REST API methods.
- Enforces authentication and claims validation.
- Retrieves the original conversation reference.
- Generates an activity for the consumer's adapter. This activity will either signal that the skill has completed or be an activity to forward to the user.

## Directly managing a skill from a skill consumer

You need to add logic to your skill consumer to track any active skills.
It is up to the consumer as to how it manages skills in general, whether it can maintain multiple active skills in parallel or not, and so on.
Specific scenarios to consider include:

- Initiating a new consumer-skill conversation. (This will be associated with a specific consumer-user conversation.)
  - To pass parameters to a skill, set the _value_ property in the initial activity to the skill.
- Continuing an existing consumer-skill conversation.
- Recognizing an `endOfConversation` activity from the skill as signalling an end of a consumer-skill conversation.
  - To retrieve any return value from a skill, check the activity's _value_ property.
  - To check why the skill is ending, check the activity's _code_ parameter, which could indicate that the skill encountered an error.
- Cancelling a skill from the consumer by sending an `endOfConversation` activity to the skill.

See how to [implement a skill consumer](skill-implement-consumer.md) for a consumer that manages a skill directly.

## Using a skill dialog ot manage a skill

If you are using the [dialogs library](bot-builder-concept-dialog.md), you can use a _skill dialog_ to manage a skill. While the skill dialog is the active dialog, it will forward activities to the associated skill.

- When you create the skill dialog, use the _dialog options_ parameter to provide all the information the dialog needs to manage the skill, such as the consumer's app ID and callback URL, the conversation ID factory to use, the skill's properties, and so on.
  - If you want to manage more than one skill as a dialog, you will need to create a separate skill dialog for each skill.
  - Often, you will add the skill dialog to a component dialog.
- To start the skill dialog, use the dialog context's _begin_ method and provide the skill dialog's ID. Use the _options_ parameter to provide the activity the consumer will send as the first activity to the skill.
- You can cancel or interrupt the skill dialog as you would any other dialog. See how to [handle user interruptions](bot-builder-howto-handle-user-interrupt.md) for an example.
