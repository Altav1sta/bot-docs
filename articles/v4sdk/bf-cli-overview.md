# Bot Framework CLI overview

[!INCLUDE[applies-to](../includes/applies-to.md)]

The Bot Framework Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool replaces the collection of standalone tools used to manage Bot Framework bots and related services. Most tools are already ported and the rest will be ported in future releases. The CLI aggregates the collection of cross-platform tools into one cohesive and consistent interface.

The old tools will be deprecated in subsequent releases. All new investments, bug fixes, and new features will be implemented in the new consolidated BF CLI alone.
