<!--TBD: Document the Python-Telemetry sample.-->
<!--Work on this hasn't started, this is just a placeholder-->

We will start with the [CoreBot sample app](https://aka.ms/py-core-sample) and add the code required to integrate telemetry into any bot. This will enable Application Insights to begin tracking requests.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have not setup your [Application Insights](https://aka.ms/appinsights-overview) account and created your [Application Insights key](../bot-service-resources-app-insights-keys.md), do that before proceeding.

1. Open the [CoreBot sample app](https://aka.ms/py-core-sample) in Visual Studio Code.
