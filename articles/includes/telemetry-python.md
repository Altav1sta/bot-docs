TBD: Document the Python-Telemetry sample.

## Prerequisites

* The [CoreBot sample code](https://aka.ms/cs-core-sample)

* The [Application Insights sample code](https://aka.ms/csharp-corebot-app-insights-sample)

* A subscription to [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com/)

* An [Application Insights key](../bot-service-resources-app-insights-keys.md)

* Familiarity with [Application Insights](https://aka.ms/appinsights-overview)

> [!NOTE]
> The [Application Insights sample code](https://aka.ms/csharp-corebot-app-insights-sample) was built on top of the [CoreBot sample code](https://aka.ms/cs-core-sample). This article will step you through modifying the CoreBot sample code to incorporate telemetry. If you are following along in Visual Studio you will have the Application Insights sample code by the time we are finished.
